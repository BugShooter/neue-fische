# TypeScript Request Exercises

This folder contains completed TypeScript exercises for networking requests using fetch and axios. You can check solutions in both Node.js and browser environments.

## How to Check and Run the Solutions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Review the code:**
   Open the `.ts` files (especially `exercieses-api-request.ts`) to see the solutions and comments for each exercise.

3. **Run the code in Node.js:**
   Compile and run the main file:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Run the code in the browser:**
   Build the project and start a local server:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run serve
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser. Interact with the UI and check the console for results.
